		<h2>Game modes</h2>
		<h3>Study</h3>
		<p>
			In Study, you are given a brief period of time to study the layout of the menu before playing a round.
		</p>
		<h3>Blitz</h3>
		<p>
			In Blitz, the layout of the menu changes every time.
		</p>
		<h3>Collections</h3>
		<p>
			In Collections, you start with 4 random items and gain more as the round increases.
			It's like playing randomizer, but without all the boring stuff. Just good ol' menuing.
		</p>
		<hr />
		<h2>Difficulties</h2>
		<p>
			There are five difficulty settings:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Beginner</li>
			<li>Easy</li>
			<li>Medium</li>
			<li>Hard</li>
			<li>Expert</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Easier difficulties will change the menu up less often, giving you more time to get used to it.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p>
			Differences between modes:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>All modes</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Beginner will overlay an outline of the optimal path it found.</li>
					<li>Beginner, Easy, and Medium have a cursor over the target item; hard and expert do not.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Study</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Higher difficulties allot less time to study the menu before playing.</li>
					<li>Menu layout changes more often in higher difficulties.</li>
					<li>In medium and expert, your starting position changes each turn of the round.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Blitz</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Higher difficulties have more rounds before the game ends.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Collections</b>
				<ul>
